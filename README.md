### ðŸ¤” What is this?
`Data Deduplication Model` is created to address the **issue of machine learning model training times due to large amounts of data**. Moreover, the ultimate goal is to effectively **reduce the size of the massive data** through data deduplication, thereby **enhancing the performance of the ML model**.  
We were able to confirm that, despite effectively reducing the quantity of data through this model, performance metrics did not deteriorate. While there may be **variation in the model's performance due to regional errors and the type of dataset**, we will strive for continuous imporvement to ensure that the model operates effectively across as many datasets as possible.
