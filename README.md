### ü§î What is this?
`Data Deduplication Model` is created to address the **issue of machine learning model training times due to large amounts of data**. Moreover, the ultimate goal is to effectively **reduce the size of the massive data** through data deduplication, thereby **enhancing the performance of the ML model**.  
We were able to confirm that, despite effectively reducing the quantity of data through this model, performance metrics did not deteriorate. While there may be **variation in the model's performance due to regional errors and the type of dataset**, we will strive for continuous imporvement to ensure that the model operates effectively across as many datasets as possible.

### üìÅ Structure Explaination
1. Root : `always-spring01/Data-Deduplication-Model/`  
 Root folder is the top-level for storing basic configuration files. You can access the folders underneath and find information in the specific folder that interests you.
2. Document : `always-spring01/Data-Deduplication-Model/docs`  
 Document folder gathers various documents to explain this model. Almost all the materials are written in Koraen, and the document types are indicated by their file extensions.
